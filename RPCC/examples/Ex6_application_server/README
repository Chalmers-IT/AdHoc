This example illustrates subclassing of the server and server configuration as well as adding authentication
and more to the online documentation.

Configuration can be done using the environment of the operating system.
IN this example, we have subclassed the sever to be able to alter the default value of some
class variables in the rpcc.Server class:
See the rpcc.server.py source code for a complete list of such class variables.
In this example we have altered envvar_prefix = "USERSERVICE_" which will
cause the default perfix for configuration environment variables to change frpm "RPCC_" to "USERSERVICE_"

Here is a list of configuration variables:

USERSERVICE_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD - The sole password usable when using the SuperuserOnlyAuthenticationManager
USERSERVICE_DEBUG_SQL - To get SQL queries printed
USERSERVICE_DB_USER - User to use Oracle or MySQL database
USERSERVICE_DB_PASSWORD - Password for that user
USERSERVICE_DB_DATABASE - Database to use
USERSERVICE_DB_HOST - Database host
USERSERVICE_DB_PORT - Database port
USERSERVICE_DB_SOCKET - Database socket

Another change is that we have provided a docroot to serve some static HTML pages servicing as
an introduction for programmers who need to access the server.
This is done using the statement
    srv.enable_static_documents('docroot')
    
Third change is that we have enabled the SuperuserOnlyAuthenticationManager which is a sample 
 authentication manager that only allows one account, #root# using the password specified in
 USERSERVICE_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD. 

Now, start personserrver.py, and point the browser to  http://localhost/12121
Check the home page and look up  the functions list that now contains session_auth_login() and session_deauth()
