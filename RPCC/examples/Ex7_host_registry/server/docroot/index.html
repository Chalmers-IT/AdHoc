<h1 style="margin-top: 60px">Welcome to the PersonServer</h1>

<div class="lvl1">
<p>TWelcome to the service doumantation for the HOSTSERVICE RPCC Server running the
<i>rpcc.py</i> framework.

<p>This page, served from theserver itself, is proof that you
can reach the server. It contains documentation mostly dynamically
generated from the RPCC server, guaranteeing up-to-date information.
</div>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<div class="lvl2">

<p>This server serves the HOSTSERV web service whose purpose is to maintain the database of all servers at the IT department.

</div>

<h2>Server primer</h2>

<div class="lvl2">

<p>This is a very quick technical look at how to use this server. No
information is included about data types or processes, you need to
read the above document as well as function definitions.

</div>

<h2>Client modules</h2>

<div class="lvl2">

<p>This server speaks plain and simple XMLRPC with the NULL
extension, JSON-RPC or SOAP. It has a session concept (see below) which it is nice
to have automated, and therefore we have client modules that does just
that.
</div>

<h3>Python</h3>

<div class="lvl3">
<p>Download <a href="rpcc_client.py">rpcc_client.py</a> and add
it to your <tt>site-packages</tt> or keep it in the same directory as
your code.
</div>

<h2>Talking XMLRPC or JSON to the server - </h2>

<div class="lvl2">

<p>This server speaks JSON or XMLRPC with the common NULL extension. If your
client expects NULL:s (undef, NIL, None, ...) to be encoded using a
<tt>&lt;nil/&gt;</tt> tag (as Python's xmlrpc module does), contact
this server on <tt>https://host:port/</tt>. If your client expects
<tt>&lt;ex:nil/&gt;</tt>, as defined by Apache, contact this server on
<tt>https://host:port/apache-xmlrpc</tt>.

</div>

<h2>Differentiating between documentation requests and RPC calls</h2>

<div class="lvl2">

<p>This server expects every HTTP POST request to be a SOAP, JSON or an XMLRPC request,
and HTTP GET requests to fetch documentation or to invoke some other custom designed functionality.

<p>The XMLRPC specification says that only HTTP POST may be used with
XMLRPC, but if your client somehow uses GET anyways, make sure you
turn such a misfeature off.

</div>

<h2>Return values</h2>

<div class="lvl2">

<p>All functions on this server return a struct. For succesful calls,
that struct contains the key "result" (with the return value as
value), and for unsuccesful calls it has the key "error" with an error
struct as value instead. Those two keys can never appear at the same
time - a call either succeeded or it did not.

<p>The error struct contains, among others, the keys 
<dl>
  <dt>name</dt>
  <dd>the error name, for example "LookupError::NoSuchHost"

  <dt>desc</dt>
  <dd>A more verbose error description <b>for programmers</b>. You
  must <b>never</b> show this message to an end user, but instead
  handle the error in a way appropriate for you application.

  <dt>traceback</dt>
  <dd>A list noting where in the argument list an errorenous argument
  appeared. The first list item is the argument number, and following
  items note parts of a possible composite argument, integers for
  lists and keys for dictionaries.

  <dt>id</dt>
  <dd>A random number unique to this call and error. If the server
  generates an InternalError, this number is logged together with the
  underlying problem on the server.
</dl>
</div>

<h2>Session handling and authentication</h2>

<div class="lvl2">

<p>Most functions are only callable inside a session, or execution
context. This is necesarry since XMLRPC (like HTTP on which it is
built) is in itself stateless.

<p>The client module available from this server has builtin
functionality to handle the sessions (it's almost all they do).

<p>To use your own XMLRPC module, start by calling the
<tt>session_start()</tt> function. The return value is a session-id,
which you include as first parameter to all functions that require a
session context.

<p>Most functions also require the session to be
authenticated. Currently there are two calls for this,
<tt>session_auth_login(session_id, username, password)</tt> and 
<tt>session_auth_kerberos(session_id, token)</tt>. The
<i>username</i> parameter accepts any Kerberos principals.
The <tt>token</tt> parameter should be fetched with the appropriate GSSAPI functions.
See the python code within the rpcc client for details.


</div>

<h2>Online documentation</h2>

<div class="lvl2">

<p>You can get the online documentation for every PersonServer function
using the <tt>server_documentation(function_name)</tt> function
(returns a formatted string) or
<tt>server_documentation_struct(function_name)</tt> function (returns
a structure with the same information), and list all available
functions using <tt>server_list_functions()</tt>.

<p>You can also use your web browser to contact the RPCC server, and
go to the <tt>http://host:port/api/0/<i>function_name</i></tt>
page.

<p>A list of all functions is available from <a
href="/api/0">http://host:port/api/0</a>.
