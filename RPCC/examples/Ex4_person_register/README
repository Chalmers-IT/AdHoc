This is litte more complicated example which implements a simple person register.

To do that, we introduce a database and a data model for a person.

The database uses the simple SQLite database engine since it requires so little administration.
In fact, with RPCC, there is no database administration whatsoever. In this example, RPCC will deduce the required
database tables and create them.

The data model for a person is implemented in the person.py source file.

This example also makes use of RPCC's automatic reference documentation system. This exposes on port 80
the reference for all the functions that the server implements.
After starting the server, point your browser to http://localhost:12121/api/0.

See the README files in the client and server directories for a walkthrough on the source code.
