This example introduces new function, hello_to, similar to the hello function in the previous example.
The new function takes a parameter which is returned within the friendly greeting sent back by the hello_to function.

This example also introduces the rpcc_client library, which makes it a lot simpler to write advanced rpcc clients.

The client directory contains two different clients, one using the urllib and one
using the provided rpcc_client library. The proxy exposed by the rpcc library images the functions of the server as
functions in the client program using the proxy.

The server defines one function without parameters nemad hello which returns a friendly greeting.

The hello_toclient uses the low level urllib to send the JSON dump of a dict containing
two values, function and params, containing the fucntion name hello and a parameter containing one 
parameter
and subsequently read the answer back
