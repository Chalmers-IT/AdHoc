INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:

Installation assumes a Unix/Linux or Mac OS X system having bash and python version 2.6+ installed beforehand.

As the installation can be done in many ways, the path and procedure may vary greatly with your system and your preferences.
The following is only an example of an installation for all users on a typical unix based system:

1. Create a local account, (Make sure that the account exists in PDB first)

2. Log in as that account

3. Remove everything in the home directory
   cd ~ && rm -rf *.??*

4. Download the printermap package from the distribution server
   wget --no-check-certificate https://utveckling.ita.chalmers.se/sites/utveckling.ita.chalmers.se/files/printermap-x.y.z.tar
   tar -xf printermap-x.y.z.tar
   ln -s printermap-x.y.z printermap

5. Copy printermap/etc/bashrc.private.prototype to printermap/etc/bashrc.private and set restricted permissions
   cp printermap/etc/bashrc.private.prototype printermap/etc/bashrc.private && chmod go-rwx printermap/etc/bashrc.private
   Edit the printermap/etc/bashrc.private file and enter the password for the AdHoc user.
    
6. Edit etc/bashrc.private and insert the appropriate passwords instead of XXX

7. Make a link to printermap/etc/.bashrc from home directory
   ln -s printermap/.bashrc
