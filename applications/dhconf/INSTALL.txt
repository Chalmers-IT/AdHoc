INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:

Installation assumes a Unix/Linux or Mac OS X system having bash and python version 2.6+ installed beforehand.
The used python version needs to have the kerberos module available for import.
The kerberos module is likely to be available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kerberos.


As the installation can be done in many ways, the path and procedure may vary greatly with your system and your preferences.
The following is only an example of an installation for all users on a typical unix based system:

Download the dhconf package from the distribution server
wget --no-check-certificate https://utveckling.ita.chalmers.se/sites/utveckling.ita.chalmers.se/files/dhconf-x.y.z.tar

Change to a directory where you want to store the installation /usr/local/lib

cd /usr/local/lib
tar -xf dhconf-x.y.z.tar
ln -s dhconf-x.y.z dhconf

Install a symlink from /usr/local/bin to the dhconf script

cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s /usr/local/lib/dhconf/dhconf dhconf

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPGRADE PROCEDURE:

cd /usr/local/lib

Download the dhconf package from the distribution server
wget --no-check-certificate https://utveckling.ita.chalmers.se/sites/utveckling.ita.chalmers.se/files/dhconf-v.w.u.tar

tar -xf dhconf-v.w.u.tar
rm dhconf
ln -s dhconf-v.w.u dhconf
