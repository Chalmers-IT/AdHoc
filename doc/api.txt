Basic data types
================

Host
====

The host datatype represents a host computer in the network, whether it is a physical machine or a virtual.

The host datatype holds the following data:

id              A Unique idaentifier for the host. This is not the same thing as the host's DNS name. 
                This is the ID with which we refer the host when doing administrative operations and is used
                as the host name in dhcpd.conf.
                Its syntax is similar to that of a DNS name, but dots (.) are forbidden so that it may not
                be confused with a DNS name. This field may not be null.
                
dns             The DNS name of the host. May be null, if not, the host may not be part of a pool.
                The DNS name may be used for looking up a host in the administrative interface, but should never be
                reported outward as being a host ID. In dhcpd.conf it is used as the specifier to the fixed-address option.
                
group           The AdHoc group in which the host belongs. Default group is 'plain'. This is the group in dhcpd.conf where
                the host is actually located.

mac             The media access control address (MAC) which is used by the host to identify itself to the DHCP server.

owner           The cid of the host owner. This is used for access control. default is 'root'.

room            The room code for the machine's physical location. This information is used for generating printer information. May be null.

category        Categorizes the host wrt what operations may be applied to the host and by whom. Default is 'Normal'

optionspace     Defined any option spaces used for that host. May be NULL.

changed_by      The cid of the person who last changed any data for this host.

mtime           Time of last modification. This is automatically handled by the database.

info            Freetext information about the machine.

bootmode        Specified which boot mide the host is currently in. May be either of: disk, install, update_keytab and will_install.

installinfo     This field contains returned data from the installation process.

entry_status    Status of this host entry, one of Acitve, Dead or Inactive.

last_installed  A timestamp telling when the machine was last installed.
