API for AdHoc.

Basic data types
================



Host
====

The host datatype represents a host computer in the network, whether it is a physical machine or a virtual.

The host datatype holds the following data:

id              A Unique identifier for the host. This is no longer the same thing as the host's DNS name. 
                This is the ID with which we refer the host when doing administrative operations and is used
                as the host "name" in dhcpd.conf.
                Its syntax is similar to that of a DNS name, but dots (.) are forbidden so that it may not
                be confused with a DNS name. This field may not be null.
                
dns             The DNS name of the host. May be null, if not, the host may not be part of a pool or have a fixed address.
                The DNS name may be used for looking up a host in the administrative interface, but should never be
                reported outward as being a host ID. In dhcpd.conf it is used as the specifier to the fixed-address option.
                
group           The AdHoc group in which the host belongs. Default group is 'plain'. This is the group in dhcpd.conf where
                the host is actually located.

mac             The media access control address (MAC) which is used by the host to identify itself to the DHCP server.

room            The room code for the machine's physical location. This information is used for generating printer information. May be null.
                It is currently disputed whether this field is needed or not.

optionspace     Defines any option spaces used for that host. May be NULL.

changed_by      The cid of the person who last changed any data for this host.

mtime           Time of last modification. This is automatically handled by the database.

info            Freetext information about the machine.

entry_status    Status of this host entry, one of Acitve, Dead or Inactive.

Group
=====
This datatype is used in order to group hosts or other groups together. 
The groups may form a strict tree of groups such that a group may be containd within another group.
In such cases, options defined in an outer group are inherited unless the same option is defined in the inner group.

groupname       Defines the name of the group.

parent_group    Refers to the parent group of the group tree.

Class
=====
This datatype defines a class of hosts. This separation is done with a match statement 
that checks the vendor class identifier.

classname       The name of the class

optionspace     Defines any option spaces used for this class. May be NULL.

vendor_class_id Defines the vendor class id to check for when determining whethjer a calling clinet belongs to the class or not.

Pool
====
This datatype defines pools of addresses that will be treated differently than another pool of addresses, 
even on the same network segment or subnet.

poolname        The pool name.

optionspace     Defines any option spaces used for this class. May be NULL.

network         Defines the network in which the pool lives. This is a mandatory field.

info            Freetext information about the pool.

start_ip        The first IP address in the range, specified as a dotted numeric address, e.g. 129.16.45.19. Not as a DNS name.

end_ip          The last IP address in the range, specified as a dotted numeric address, e.g. 129.16.45.19. Not as a DNS name.

served_by       The ID of the DHCP server that serves the specified range,

changed_by      The cid of the person who last changed any data for this range.

Literal_option
==============
This datatype is used for specifying options literally, in the lanuage of dhcpd.conf. It is used in the cases where it is not
possible to specify options using a simple key/value schema. Literal options may be applied on hosts, groups, classes and pools,
but the datatype is the same in all four cases.
id              ID for referencing.

for             ID for which this literal option should be applied. This field may thus refer to a host, a group, a class or a pool.

value           The value of the literal as a raw string to be entered as-id into dhcpd.conf at the right point.

changed_by      The cid of the person who last changed any data for this option.

mtime           Time of last modification. This is automatically handled by the database.

Operations:
In the following, type is either host, group, class or pool
id = literal_create(for, type, value)
literal_get(id)
id_list = literal_list([for] [, type])
literal_update(id, value)
literal_delete(id)



Option
======
This datatype is used for specifying options to be applied on hosts, groups, classes, pools, networks or subnetworks.

for             ID for which this literal option should be applied. This field may thus refer to a host, a group, a class, a pool, a networ or a subnetwork.

name            The name of the option to specify. This name refers to an option_def which defines the characteristics of this option.

value           The value of the literal, internally stored as a string. However the type of the option as defined by its option_def may restrict what can be entered into this string.

changed_by      The cid of the person who last changed any data for this option.

mtime           Time of last modification. This is automatically handled by the database.

id              An internal id for the option, automatically handled by the database.

Operations:
In the following, type is either host, group, class, pool, network or subnetwork
option_create(for, type, name, value)
option_get(for, type, name)
option_update(for, type, name, value)
option_delete(for, type, name)
id_list = option_list(for, type)



Option_def
==========
This datatype defines the characteristics of a DHCP option as used by the option datatype.

id              An internal ID for the option definition, automatically handled by the database.

name            The name of the option to which these characteristics apply.

code            The code in the DHCP protocol used for this option. An integer between 0 and 255.

qualifier       Defines whether the option is to be treated as an array and/or an a standard DHCP protocol parameter. There are four possible values:
                NULL:   The option is a scalar option.
                array:  The option is an array
                parameter: The option is a scalar standard DHCP parameter.
                parameter-array: The option is an array and a standard DHCP parameter.
                
type            Defines the type of the value or of the elements in case of being an array. There are ten different types, as defined by dhcp_options(5):
                ip-address: The ip-address data type can be entered either as an explicit IP address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain name (e.g., haagen.isc.org). 
                integer 32: The int32 data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.
                integer 16: The int16 data type specifies a signed 16-bit integer.
                integer  8: The int8 data type specifies a signed 16-bit integer.
                unsigned integer 32: The uint32 data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.
                unsigned integer 16: The uint16 data type specifies an usigned 16-bit integer.
                unsigned integer  8: The uint8 data type specifies an usigned 16-bit integer.
                text: The text data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which must be enclosed in double quotes
                string: An option whose type is a data string is essentially just a collection of bytes, and can be specified either as quoted text, 
                        like the text type, or as a list of hexadecimal contents separated by colons whose values must be between 0 and FF
                boolean: An option of type boolean is a flag with a value of either on or off (or true or false).
                
optionspace     Defines for which option namespace this definition is valid. If null, it is valid outside any namespaces.

encapsulate     If defined, the contents of the option space specified will be encapsulated into this option. In this case the type and qualifier fields are ignored.
                It requires that the given option space is defined.
                
struct          This field turns the option into a structure. The structure is defined as a string containing a list comma separated types as defined above. The string
                must start with a { and end with a }.
                
info            Freetext information about the option.

changed_by      The cid of the person who last changed any data for this option.

mtime           Time of last modification. This is automatically handled by the database.

Operations:
id = optiondef_create(name, code, qualifier, type, info [,struct_def])
id = optiondef_create_encapsulated(name, code, optionspace)
optiondef_get(id)
optiondef_update(id, what, value)
optiondef_delete(id)
id_list = optiondef_list()



Optionspace
===========

name            A string that defines the name, or prefix, of the namespace.

type            Specifies whether the option space is site- or vendor local. Can assume the values 'vendor' or 'site'.

info            Freetext information about the option space.

changed_by      The cid of the person who last changed any data for this option.

mtime           Time of last modification. This is automatically handled by the database.
