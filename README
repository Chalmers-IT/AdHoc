AdHoc - Advanced DHCP Online Configuration

This system makes it possible to configure an enterprise level DHCP system using on-line network tools.

There are four levels of this system: The DHCP servers, An RPC server, A configuration database and configuration clients.

The RPC server and database are supposed to work together in a way that the RPC server isolates the database from
the surrounding world.

The DHCP servers continuously polls the RPC server for new condiguration data, and the configuration tools operate on the 
configuration data through the RPC server.

For kerberos authentication to work, the file etc/server.keytab must be created and have keys for the priciipal HTTP/<hostname>

For server installation & upgrade: see server/server_setup.txt
